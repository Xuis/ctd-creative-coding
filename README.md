## Course Description

This course explores creative uses of software development while introducing foundational programming concepts, techniques, and best practices. Using Processing and p5.js, students will learn a wide variety of tools that enable the creation of art, animation, interactivity, music, data visualization, and even utilitarian applications. While focusing on graphics, multimedia, and interactivity, the class will also touch on the importance of building the "digital plumbing" that supports our creative work.

## Objectives

* Gain and reinforce basic programming skills to build creative software applications
* Learn how to self-educate and find answers to very specific problems while developing code skills
* Learn to love code via exposure to (and practice with) a wide array of tools, techniques and concepts
* Learn about the landscape of artists, tools, and roles of people in the "creative coding" field
* Build, document, and present original pieces of software

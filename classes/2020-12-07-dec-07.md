## üìù Final Project Guidelines

* Guidelines originally posted in the [Nov 2nd class](./classes/2020-11-02-nov-02.md)
* Goals:
  * Combine your interests (code and not-code)
  * Build something meaningful for yourself
  * Experiment with a specific technology that interests you
  * Flex your skills
  * Learn some new techniques & revisit topics we've discussed in class
* Deliverables:
  * The code itself, uploaded or hosted on your own website or Google Drive/Dropbox/etc
  * One or more of the following: 
    * A live version of your code running on a website
    * A .zip file with the code that can be run locally
    * A video recap of the code in action
  * Documentation:
    * Screenshots and/or video screen recordings that show off the output and program features
    * A description of the piece (and title if applicable). At least 1 paragraph about what you've created, what you learned, tools, techniques, and anything else that makes your project interesting. Tell a story.
    * Documentation should ideally go into your portfolio or exist on the web somewhere. You host it on your own website, the p5js editor, YouTube/Vimeo, or otherwise.

## üõ†Ô∏è Languages & IDEs

* Language differences & use-cases
  * OO vs functional
  * [Typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)
* IDEs - what can they do for you?

* Let's find a tool that we want to learn, and we'll use that

## üõ†Ô∏è Control flow

* How does a program execute?
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to build anything

* [Break the problem down](https://twitter.com/monicaaquirk/status/1298447577671561216)
* Google the components
* Ask someone!
* Easier said than done - build your toolkit
* How to actually get something done when it's so open-ended?

## üõ†Ô∏è Remapping numbers

* Shaping our sketches
  * User input
  * Sliders
  * Random numbers
  * Data
  * noise()
  * sin()
  * lerp()
  * map()
* Normalizing numbers
* Using `map()` - Live demo
  * Map mouse input - normalize and use for rotation
  * Map time (seconds to screen width)

## üõ†Ô∏è Animation

* `lerp()` Live demo

## üìù Homework:

* Read:
  * [On Meta-Design and Algorithmic Design Systems](https://runemadsen.com/blog/on-meta-design-and-algorithmic-design-systems/) by Rune Madsen
    * [MIT Media Lab's Brilliant New Logo Has 40,000 Permutations](https://www.fastcompany.com/1663378/mit-media-labs-brilliant-new-logo-has-40000-permutations-video)
    * [Cacheflowe - Nightlines](https://cacheflowe.com/art/physical/nightlines-t-shirt)
* Watch:
  * [Juice it or lose it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg)
    * See how animation effects give a boring game personality
* Choose a secondary tool for the semester. Some suggestions:
  * Web tech: html/css/canvas/svg
  * Processing
  * openFrameworks
  * Unity or Unreal
  * Touch Designer
  * VVVV
  * Nannou
  * OpenRNDR
  * Sonic Pi
  * Chuck
* Build a clock
  * Textual, graphical, or both
  * Make it abstract or conceptual, not just a [literal clock](https://p5js.org/examples/input-clock.html)
  * Some ideas
    * User [millis()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/millis) for fine-grained time display
    * Build a countdown clock?
      * How many years do you have left to live? Use variables to calculate
      * [Doomsday Clock](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/)
      * How long before Covid is over, with variables added to the equation
    * Show multiple time zones?
    * Does time of day influence the color or drawing style?
    * Add sound
    * Reveal the rhythm of time with shapes
    * Use Javascript for more [Date functions](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-dates/)
    * Turn the time into another "poster" and change the content depending on the time of day
  * Inspiration
    * [Raven Kwok: Time](http://ravenkwok.com/time/)
    * [Humans since 1982: A Million Times](https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/60491636)
    * [Reza Ali: Reactions](https://www.instagram.com/p/CBogs4FH4E0/)
  * Steps
    * Sketch it out on paper
    * Write some code, see if it sticks
      * Sometimes the code will lead us down different, interesting paths
    * Pivot when something isn't working and try a different approach
